# robotic-garbage-cans-with-arms

with solar powered panels to recharge in the day and energy storage for night 

as a concept for areas that don't deal with snow or ice weather conditions

35 gallon garbage cans with 4.5 ft arms that pickup garbage and self contain it

with internal weight measurement to know when it's reaching it's internal cargo capacity for a garbage collection robot

knowing on a short proximity when an object on the ground has been dormant for 2 hours by visual tracking if the object has been collected by image recognition of the object

as.an example it can circle an area like a parking lot to know thst it won't leave the bounds of a known area that it maintains to collect garbage


think malls, stores, gas stations, mini marts

possible that the garbage can would consume the garbage chemically through industrial chemical breakdown by keeping internal liquid to break down HDPE and LDPE plastics and other wastes

by possibly creating it's own HCL acid breakdown using standard water and heat with table salt to create HCL for it's internal guts 

could also be a garbage can on the street corner that breaks down garbage to liquid depending on weekly refills of 5 gallons of water and 1kg of salt with sanitation workers supply water and salt to each corner garbage can to break down garbage as a liquid 

todo -> after the garbage liquidifies the garbage can would also treat the liquid with a heavy ph basic component like KOH to neutralize the acidic liquid

(as a basic concept chemical mix not an actual stoimetric ratio(

# saw one of these locally could be used to pickup garbage in parking lots or gas station lots or open areas in general
# it it was slightly larger 3ft * 3ft 3ft
# AND if it had a flat metal "spatula" type of robotic appendage as a robotic arm where the spatula would have a flat "clamp" to grasp or grip a flat piece of garbage or flattened piece of garbage
