# robotic-garbage-cans-with-arms

with solar powered panels to recharge in the day and energy storage for night 

as a concept for areas that don't deal with snow or ice weather conditions

35 gallon garbage cans with 4.5 ft arms that pickup garbage and self contain it

with internal weight measurement to know when it's reaching it's internal cargo capacity for a garbage collection robot

knowing on a short proximity when an object on the ground has been dormant for 2 hours by visual tracking if the object has been collected by image recognition of the object

as.an example it can circle an area like a parking lot to know thst it won't leave the bounds of a known area that it maintains to collect garbage


think malls, stores, gas stations, mini marts
